Description: Method and tool for generating time series forecasts using
        an ensemble wavelet-based auto-regressive neural network architecture. This method provides
        additional support of exogenous variables and also generates confidence interval. This 
        package provides EWNet model for time series forecasting based on the algorithm by
        Panja, et al. (2022) and Panja, et al. (2023) <arXiv:2206.10696> <doi:10.1016/j.chaos.2023.113124>.
